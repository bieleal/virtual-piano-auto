# 🎹 Virtual Piano AUTO

An **AutoHotkey v2** script that automatically plays piano sheets (Virtual Piano / Roblox), built with a strong focus on **performance ⚡**, **stability 🛡️**, and **real-world usability**.

It features a **custom dark UI 🌑**, borderless window, real-time tempo control 🎚️, and a token-based playback system (keys, chords, and pauses).

The script **updates itself automatically 🔄** on startup, always pulling the latest version with fixes and improvements — no manual downloads needed.
